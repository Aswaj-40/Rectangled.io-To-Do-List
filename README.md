In this to-do list app, we can add filter with any name and give any color. We can add multiple filters (eg: Personal, Freelance, Work etc). The added filters will be saved with the font color of given filter color. We can choose the filters that we are added and add a task. When we are adding a task, Enter the task name, Date, Time and choose the filter you want. In scheduled task we can see the task you are added with Date, Time, and the filter that you selected.
